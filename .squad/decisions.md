# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### Performance Audit (2026-03-19)

#### 1. Optimize WebSocket Message Processing (Rick — Lead)
- **Decision:** Skip JSON parsing on hot path using regex extraction for message type. Cache JSON serialization for order summaries. Pre-serialize static WebSocket messages at module import.
- **Impact:** Eliminates ~30 json.loads calls/sec per session on audio delta hot path (~95% of traffic). Removes redundant Pydantic serialization.
- **Trade-off:** Message routing depends on regex pattern validity (tested).

#### 2. Constrain Model Output Tokens (Rick)
- **Decision:** Set `max_response_output_tokens = 150` in voice interactions.
- **Rationale:** Voice responses should be 1-2 sentences. Without a cap, model can generate long responses increasing latency and audio playback time.
- **Trade-off:** Very complex orders might be slightly truncated. Monitor and increase to 200 if needed.

#### 3. Reduce AI Search Over-Fetching (Rick)
- **Decision:** Reduce KNN from 50→15, top results from 5→3 in Azure AI Search queries.
- **Rationale:** KNN=50 retrieves 50 matches for 5-result return (10x overfetch). For structured menu (~100 items), KNN=15 sufficient. Reduces token processing load.
- **Trade-off:** Edge cases with very ambiguous queries might miss a 4th/5th result. Acceptable for drive-thru context.

#### 4. Isolate Per-Connection WebSocket State (Summer)
- **Decision:** Move `_tools_pending` from shared RTMiddleTier dict to local scope in `_forward_messages()`. Each connection gets its own tracking dict.
- **Rationale:** Concurrent WebSocket clients were interfering via shared state. Race condition eliminated.
- **Risk:** None identified.

#### 5. Fast-Path Audio Messages (Summer)
- **Decision:** Define `_PASSTHROUGH_TYPES` frozenset (13 message types never modified). Return immediately after JSON parse, skip match/case logic.
- **Rationale:** During active speech, ~90% of messages are audio deltas. This optimization reduces per-message processing overhead.
- **Impact:** Single async task model still works; optimization is purely throughput.

#### 6. Implement Search Result Caching (Summer)
- **Decision:** Add `_SearchCache` with 60s TTL, 128-entry max for Azure AI Search results.
- **Rationale:** Repeated menu queries are common in drive-thru (same item asked multiple times). Eliminates redundant Azure round-trips.
- **Risk:** Cache invalidation: if menu changes frequently, consider shorter TTL.

#### 7. Reduce Search Response Payload (Summer)
- **Decision:** Cut `select_fields` from 11 to 5 fields in Azure Search queries.
- **Rationale:** Only 5 fields used in result formatting. Reduces network payload and Azure Search response time.
- **Trade-off:** None; filtering reduces bloat.

#### 8. Gzip Compression for HTTP Responses (Summer)
- **Decision:** Add `_compression_middleware` for text-based responses (JSON, JS, HTML, SVG). Skip WebSocket and streaming.
- **Impact:** 60-70% reduction in HTTP payload for typical JSON responses.
- **Overhead:** Minimal (compression on-the-fly, cached for static assets).

#### 9. Reuse AudioContext Across Sessions (Morty)
- **Decision:** Keep single AudioContext instance for player and recorder, reuse across recording/playback cycles.
- **Rationale:** AudioContext creation takes 50-100ms (OS-level audio device negotiation). Reuse eliminates this latency on every session start.
- **Risk:** Edge case where audio device is unplugged mid-session. Handled by graceful fallback (current error handling).

#### 10. Zero-Allocation Audio Capture Buffer (Morty)
- **Decision:** Replace O(n²) buffer append pattern with pre-allocated doubling buffer and `copyWithin()`.
- **Rationale:** Old pattern created new Uint8Array on every chunk (~20-50x/sec), copying all accumulated data. Caused GC pressure and frame drops.
- **Impact:** Near-zero allocation during audio hot path.

#### 11. Memoize Leaf React Components (Morty)
- **Decision:** Wrap `OrderSummary`, `TranscriptPanel`, `MenuPanel`, `StatusMessage`, `BrandHero`, `SessionTokenBanner` with React.memo.
- **Rationale:** These re-rendered on every parent state change even when props didn't change. MenuPanel and BrandHero are fully static.
- **Impact:** Transcript updates no longer trigger menu/hero re-renders. Surgical updates only.

#### 12. Remove Polling Timer in TranscriptPanel (Morty)
- **Decision:** Remove `setInterval` that called `setCurrentTime(new Date())` every second.
- **Rationale:** This caused entire transcript panel to re-render every second, even when idle. Timestamp comparison now uses adjacent transcript entries.
- **Impact:** Eliminated ~1 re-render/second.

#### 13. Lazy-Load Settings Component (Morty)
- **Decision:** Use `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` for Settings panel.
- **Rationale:** Settings rarely opened, includes Dialog/Sheet/Switch (~7.4 kB gzipped). No reason to load on initial page render.
- **Impact:** Faster initial page load.

#### 14. Strategic Vendor Chunking (Morty)
- **Decision:** Replace per-package `manualChunks` with explicit groups: `react-vendor`, `ui-vendor`, `i18n`, `motion`.
- **Rationale:** Old pattern created hundreds of tiny files. Strategic grouping produces fewer, larger chunks with better caching and fewer HTTP requests.
- **Impact:** Improved cache hit rate, reduced network requests in production.

#### 15. Disable Sourcemaps in Production (Morty)
- **Decision:** Set `sourcemap: false` in Vite build config for production builds.
- **Rationale:** Sourcemaps expose source code and increase artifact size. Not needed in production.
- **Impact:** Smaller deploy artifacts.

#### 16. Exponential Backoff for WebSocket Reconnection (Morty)
- **Decision:** Implement exponential backoff (1s base, 30s cap) with random jitter for reconnection attempts.
- **Rationale:** Default instant-retry can overwhelm server during outages (thundering herd). Backoff with jitter distributes reconnection load.
- **Impact:** More resilient connection recovery, server-friendly.

#### 17. Gunicorn Configuration for WebSocket (Squanchy)
- **Decision:** 2 async workers, 120s timeout, 65s keep-alive.
- **Rationale:** Async handles many concurrent connections. 120s timeout protects long-lived WebSocket sessions. 65s keep-alive matches Azure LB 60s idle timeout.
- **Risk:** Worker count should be monitored against memory usage (Azure SDK overhead).

#### 18. Container Apps Auto-Scaling (Squanchy)
- **Decision:** HTTP scaling at 20 concurrent requests per replica, max 5 replicas, min 1.
- **Rationale:** Each replica runs 2 async workers. 20 concurrent/replica is conservative starting point. Min 1 prevents cold-start.
- **Risk:** Threshold should be validated with real WebSocket load testing.

#### 19. Health Probes: Startup + Liveness + Readiness (Squanchy)
- **Decision:** Dedicated `/health` endpoint with generous startup probe (50s budget), liveness every 30s, readiness every 10s.
- **Rationale:** Startup probe allows gunicorn + pip deps to initialize. Liveness detects hung workers. Readiness gates traffic routing.
- **Trade-off:** 50s startup budget is conservative but acceptable for one-time initialization.

#### 20. Docker Layer Caching (Squanchy)
- **Decision:** Copy dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt) first, install, then copy source code.
- **Impact:** Dependency layer cached across code-only changes (saves 60-90s per rebuild).
- **Trade-off:** None; pure efficiency.

#### 21. Configurable Log Level (Squanchy)
- **Decision:** `LOG_LEVEL` env var controls logging (defaults to INFO). Can be set to DEBUG without code redeploy.
- **Rationale:** Enables troubleshooting by restarting container with new env var, avoiding full redeployment.
- **Impact:** Faster debugging cycle.

#### 22. Performance Test Harness (Birdperson)
- **Decision:** Implement 28 tests covering latency (<5ms order_state ops, <10ms search, <2ms JSON), memory (<1MB delta, <2MB peak), thread safety, and production readiness.
- **Rationale:** Quantifiable baseline for future optimization. Thresholds have ~10× headroom for operational margin. All Azure calls mocked (zero external dependencies).
- **Impact:** Regression protection, team confidence in production readiness.
- **Trade-off:** Thresholds can be tightened post-optimization if needed.
